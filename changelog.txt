[Fixed]
- Call recording filter (whitelist/blacklist) now works correctly
- Call recording on loudspeaker now captures both sides of the conversation
- Status download button now shows consistently
- Sharing someone else's status now correctly carries the media to the composer
- Anti-revoke now works in group chats

Thanks @grkmcngns for detailed review and highlighting these issues.
